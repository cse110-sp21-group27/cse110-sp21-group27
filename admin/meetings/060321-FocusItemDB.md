In this meeting, the team hashed out the local storage database storing schema along with the creation of reuseable storage functions. Moreover, we were able to distinguish the the most salient features of focus items and the cards features that were required to reconstruct the app workspace after a refresh or a complete browser closure. Manual tests were conducted to test robustness.
