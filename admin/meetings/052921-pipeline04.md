### *The agenda of what is discussed:*

The developer team did another iteration of the CI/CD pipeline. This time we focused on implementing unit testing and puppeteering via jest. The team ran into a little trouble
at the start, but referring to documentation and examples helped pave the way forward. We were able to get started and create the necesssary files for this type of testing. 
Moving forward we need to wrap it up with a few more test cases for the script.js file and later have these files moved to the main branch. In addition, we had to update some
of the GitHub workflows as there is now code created for the BuJo project.
