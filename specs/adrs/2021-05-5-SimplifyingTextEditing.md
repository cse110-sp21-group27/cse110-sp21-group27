## Context and Problem Statement

Our team took feedback from the professor's office hours as well as TA meeting and came to conclusion to simplify the text editing area of our bullet Journal.

## Considered Options

* Signifiers
* bullets (includes sub-bullets and check box bullets)
* include insert images

### Positive Consequences

* Allow for quick logging
* Easier to implement

### Negative Consequences
* NA

## Pros and Cons of the Options
Pros, this decision allowed for a more bullet journal aspect and less of a notebook.
