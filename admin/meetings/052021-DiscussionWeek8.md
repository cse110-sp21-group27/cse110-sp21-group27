Feedback from TAs:
- Only the background to be noticed if focused on
    - either layer blur or white tint
    - hero patterns / svg backgrounds
- schedule view

- we'll experiment on background later on (polish)
- Focus items should be larger.
- Is the checkmark important? 
    - can we somehow automate its completion 
    - hard to determine what the box means  
- Notecard color coordination
    - can the dev team do it?
- Function Hierarchy:
- Focus item
  - focus 
- Views
  - drag and drop time blocks
  - autocompleting focus items when dragging it into a time block
  - highlighting the current day
- Cards
  - card content 
- Card Colors
- Backgrounds


Most of the feedback gave us insights on how to potentially design components of the app and clearing up the hierarchy of actions that can be made with our bullet journal. Moreover, our currently plain skeleton will be much improved with the inclusion of backgrounds as otherwise the gravity of the app is quite low.
