### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
Today was the day that we got most of the work done for the pitch document. Everyone was responsible for skimming the
necessary texts, the brainstorms, as well as the assignment over the week. Moreover, everyone had come up with a unique
persona and we sent time combining and refactoring their details into 4 distinct personas that targeted our user base
(students) . Alan had taken charge of the wireframing for the project, and he continued to hash them out and planned to have then ready by Sunday.

Essentially, the pitch was broken down into 4 pieces: the problem and solution, the personas/wireframes, the planning
and process, and finally the features/no gos (risks and rabbit holes). We split up the team into fairly equal parts and
got to work. We set ourselves 2 working periods and reconvened to clear up any confusion. We found this method to be
quite efficient, and we plan to use the methodology in the future. 

Important aspects of the coding process must be discussed on tuesday to help us figure out a workflow to complete our bullet journal in a timely manner.

Key factors: low fidelity wireframing, high fidelity wireframing get them done before monday.
Attend professor office hours along with cross team discussion. Starting Pitch completed.
