## Deepak group meeting: 04/13/2021
### 6:30 PM
_**Present: Gourab, Samyak, Sarah, Issac, Xun, Richie, Raymond**_
Today was the first meeting that we had with your teaching assistant Deepak. He was able to give quite a few experiences on how to approach the project from the beginning by explaining the rubric and grading process. Moreover, we got insights from his previous stints with the class and what to expect in the coming weeks. Following his deep dive on how to make our project stand out, he was able to give us an update on what progress should be made. We definitely will take into consideration the ways to manage documentation and the overview of software engineering principles. Today was mainly an introductory meeting, but it has set us up with a great support system to aid our project development. 

Deepak left the meeting at 7:01pm
