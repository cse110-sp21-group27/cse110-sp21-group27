### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
After some careful research about how to manipualte drag and drop, we were able to figure a need for multiple case handling of drag behavior that finally got the features of populating the draggables and the focus items. After this we were able to find a way to store the dragged locations of the focus items and pin them to a given time slot for a given date. This was quite the breakthrough as our troubles with the daily view left us in the dilemma of not including this feature in our final project. 

Following this we decided to continue on our quest of finishing the styling of the app by adding more backgrounds to the columns, the daily view, and adding the ability to change the colors of the cards. 
Finally, we figured out our plans for the video as we would need to provide Alan with pictures and a couple short clips explaining the criteria of the assignment. Moreover, Xun, Richie, and Sarah made good progress on the final documentation allowing us to plan final testing for tomorrow and submission goals.
