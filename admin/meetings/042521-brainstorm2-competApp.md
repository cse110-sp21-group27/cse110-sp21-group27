### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We were able to discuss all of the app that we delegated in the previous meeting. we were able to deduce that the User interface is one of the most telling features that entices user. The majority of the flaws found in Notion, Trello, Taskade, and OneNote were all noted in our brainstorm miro document.

We then color coded and formed a basis on things to avoid and incorporate for our rendition of a bullet journal application. This competetive analysis defintiely helped us figure out new features that we were unable to suggest in our previous session. Moreover, we were better able to gauge our app's feature set to its competition.

After this discussion, we planned for the future with our Starting Pitch due in the coming week along with future wireframing preliminaries. Finally, we began our daily standups today and made the decision to give a daily update in our designated Slack channel.

Finally, we have a temporary document and multimedia storage google drive that will help us auxiliary documentation and files that need to be formatted correctly before heading in to the Repository.
