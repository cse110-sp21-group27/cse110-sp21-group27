### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
In this meeting, the team looked at the UI and looked for areas to polish the UI with padding, finalizing the widths of the columns along with fixing up the font consistency. While attempting to this we were able to uncover some uncaught bugs are were able to rectify them quickly with regards to focus item creation and page refreshing as we had a weird situation were the number of focus items were not updating consistently in local storage. Moreover, we were able to incorporate daily view with the rest of the components with the drag and drop working with dummy data.
