### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We overhauled our basic wireframe taking into account the feedback we received in professor office hours and our recent TA meeting. Conversations included simplifying the text editing area. Making a two tiered application that minimizes overall text movement to keep users more engaged. Moreover there is more strucutre with a left-handed menu structure to have easy access to general setting.

Things to remeber, new recurring meetings to be held with TA on thursday or friday. High-fidelity protype must be shown and cross pollinated with other teams.
