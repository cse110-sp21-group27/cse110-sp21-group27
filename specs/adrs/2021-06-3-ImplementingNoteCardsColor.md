* Date: [2021-06-3] 


## Context and Problem Statement

After meeting with the team we decided to add some color onto the note cards. The CSS team proposed the idea of adding colors because the page was little bland and lack the idea of allowing user to customize thier own page. Overall, the team was happy with the suggestion and we talked about implementing the color should be simple.

## Considered Options

* Add some colors to note card
* Have the option to allow users to change color of each individual note card
* We will have 4 unqiue base colors

## Decision Outcome
We decided to add color to note card. Alan and Raymond decided to only have 4 base color and consult with the team. We also decided to add the option to allow user to change color on its own.

### Positive Consequences
* This will lead to a more aesthetically pleasing site.
* This will also allow user to have a more personal attachment to the journal.

### Negative Consequences
* User may not like the fixed amount of colors to the note cards and may want more options.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
* Improve user experience and aesthetics of the produce to be more appealing to customers.
