### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We began by debriefing the office hours comments and suggestions from professor and other groups. Taking that into account we began looking for ways to split up the task and features of our project. Plans to split team into 3, design, frontend, and data oriented.

Finish high fidelity prototyping, task breakdown, and experimental prototyping.
Focus of finalizing the look and make sure that the high fidelity protype is in working order. Then try get all of the experiemntal protoytping in order to prevent getting lost in development.
