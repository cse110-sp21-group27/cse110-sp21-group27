### The Summary of the Sprint Review
- The sprint review bcgan with us reflecting back to what achieved in our first sprint. We noted that all of our software development was done sprint #2 as we completed our final high fidelity models at the end of the first sprint. The most important change that we made in this sprint was the incerased usage of team splitting on specific tasks. We saw quite a large increase in productivity with this methodolodgy and allowed to make great advances in component, documentation, testing.
- This first thing that we noted that was achieved in this sprint was the polishing of the high fidelity model by Alan. He was ablle to take feedback from multiple TAs and the professor and hints to improve our given design. We were able to make make background tweaks for greater visibility. 
- The next thing that was acheived was the skeleton of our application which was headed by Samyak. This allowed us to contribute our assigned components into one holder and see the functionality that we were trying to achieve. 
- We then made large strides in our testing suite and CI/CD pipeline, now we have Jest and Puppeteer testing up and running with a couple basic tests. Having this part of the pipline up and running was a big advancement for the team and will allow us to easily tack on tests and we close up the project.
- Afterward, we have almost completed the daily view functionality with drag and drop functionality implemented with jQuery. This was handled by Alan, Raymond, and Issac. 
- Looking at the sprint review, we have almost completed all of the functionality of the application, we will need to finish up our styling, add more tests, and consider how to finish up our documentation.
