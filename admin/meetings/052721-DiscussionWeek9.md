### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
In this meeting we were able to show off the hard work that we put into our components and showed how they were able to work individually and explain our plans to integrate them together. Moreover, we exaplined our game plan of team divding into testing, database, and extra feature development. Our feedback revolved around getting the testing suite up and running as soon as possible and we were happy to see that our late development process left us close to the other teams.
