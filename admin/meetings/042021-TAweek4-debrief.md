### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We began with strategies on how to more efficiently operate as a team and learn to not to wait for everyone on the team
to get together to make progress on the project. Divide up the work and push forward. Moreover, we were able to gain
insights about how our previous brainstorming session went, and how we could delve deeper. This led to our decision to
split our group into pairs and perform a competitive analysis between OneNote, Notion, Taskade, and Trello and their
applicability as a Bullet Journal platform. We believed that this would give a good chance to figure out a featureset beyond what we were able to come up with in our previous meetings. 

We were able to get more clarifications about the Agile process and how to handle the idea of daily-standups. Gourab took the responsibility for handling the standups and managing them within the repo. Finally, we confirmed a recurring meeting on Sunday to catch up with the team and debrief our findings from our 4 target apps.
