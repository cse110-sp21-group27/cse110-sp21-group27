### Other team feedbacks:
- Big rabbit hole: decorating a lot
- Process and Planning: Dividing tasks, specifying what the tasks are
- can do built-in guide/tutorial (not as difficult as it seems)

### Our feedback:
- keyboard shortcuts for events - letters not a good idea
- Options for data storage:
  - Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
  - Chrome storage
  - electron
- Instead of log-in, can have synchronization mechanisms
- Export to Google Calendar might not be too difficult
- Import/Export with Google Calendar works well with our user case
