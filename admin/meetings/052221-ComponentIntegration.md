### *The agenda of what is discussed:*

Each of us had been tasked to work on exploratory programming for various elements of the project. The main things that we were able to incorporate  in this collaborative session was completing the focus item display, focus item creation, along with implementing scrollability within our subsections. Another big step forward was a walkthrough of the steps of the agile workflow that we should be following. It was a good opportunity to show everyone in attendance the steps of making a separate branch and working within that branch and finally pushing the branch remotely and making a pull request to address a given assigned github issue or task in github projects.
