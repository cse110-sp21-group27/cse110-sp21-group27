### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
The two big things on the agenda were to complete the up coming assignments for the CI/CD pipeline along with the ADR documentation for the coming Monday. As a result, we split the team into two parts, the devs would take on the the CI/CD pipeline and the Alan our designer would aid the team leads and planner with creating the correct documentation for the process and decision making with with designs of the high-fidelity prototypes. 

We then had an in-depth discussion with Deepak about our Information Architecture and how we intend our application to help our users manage their time with specific focus items. We should be able to provide a platform for them to visualize their progress and and quickly note down important thoughts throughout their day. This led us to schedule futther meetings with the 2 sub teams to solidify our progress for the current sprint.
