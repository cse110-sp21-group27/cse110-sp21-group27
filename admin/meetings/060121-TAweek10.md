### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
In the final TA meeting, we found that our recap among the team was quite succinct as much of our work was recapped in the day's prior sprint review meeting. However, the team was able to gain many insights about the finishing steps of the project. Essentially the testing suite was up and running and the storage solution of local storage was in the works, but the important thing was to make sure to leave time for the video creation along with the user-end documentation along with the onboarding documentation that explained the layout of the code structure and CI/CD. Finally we discussed that our final deployment would be through github pages.
