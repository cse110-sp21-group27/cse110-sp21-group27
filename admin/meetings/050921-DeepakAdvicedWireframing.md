### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
Deepak gave us information on how to simplify our high-level prototypes as there was a layer of unnecessary layer of adding notebooks to our BuJo. We should instead focus on balancing time and things to do for a given user. We decided to move towards a more time-focused approach to the Bullet Journal. The major change was moving towards a calendar view base system, and restrictng things to be collection specific. This will lead to highly reduced the complexity of things that we were planning to implement such as upcoming tasks. Moreover, we made our decision to avoid tagging collections together as we realized that we were beginning to circle back to the realm of complexity.

Alan took charge to implement our finalized design decisions into a working model to hand to our development team.
