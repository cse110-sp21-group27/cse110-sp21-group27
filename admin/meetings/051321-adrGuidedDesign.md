### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We looked to delegate tasks for the ADR documentation by ensuring that meeting notes were up to date and making correctly formatted docs to support our design decisions. Moreover, Alan was able to take in the feedback from fellow team leads and planner on how to improve small aspects of the application that are too ambitious for the current timeline. This period provided a light on how to simplify much of UI and bring things closer to the 3 page style application alluded to by our TA. Moreover we decided upon only a daily and weekly view for focus items.
