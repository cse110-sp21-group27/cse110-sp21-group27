## Context and Problem Statement

After meeting with Deepak, we further simplified our high-level prototypes as there was a layer of unnecessary layer of adding notebooks to our Bullet Journal. Our design strayed away from the Bullet Journal aspect; therefore, we decided to implement a more time focused designed of our Bullet Journal to allow user to further plan and track tasks. The calendar view in our Bullet Journal would allow users to better plan tasks and view progress of tasks.
