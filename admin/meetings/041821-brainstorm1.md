### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We began with understanding what exactly a bullet journal is. Time was spent researching major factors that are essential to sucessful bullet journaling. From the factors, we extracted the basic features and use-cases that a bullet journal must fulfill. This all illustrated in a mindmap in our brainstorming Miro document. Next, we pondered what exactly our bullet journal was intending to do. We agreed upon a concept of quickly being able to write down thoughts, goals, events, and track our progress through days, weeks, and years. The bullet journal that we intend to make, will allow its user to focus on their tasks at hand and keep track of their long term goals and have ways to reflect upon their progress and work efficiency.
​
### *Any old unresolved business from the previous meeting:*
Recap of all of the information and deliverables that were submitted for our group team formation last week.
​
### *Any new business to be discussed:*
Future deliverables for the upcoming Brainstorming assignment and its deliverables. Also, keep the upcoming project pitch and design documents in the back of our minds. 
​
### *Anything that was on the agenda but was not discussed (save for next meeting's old business):*
Demoing of other online Bullet Journaling applications, and surveying the common features and how to improve upon them.
​
### *Any pending decisions or decisions made & their reasoning (if there were dissenting opinions include them, then write why the group decided to make that decision anyways):*
Still undecided on the complete theme of the application, leaning towards and student oriented app for maintaining control over ones tasks and events. May need to consider broader scheme for personas.
