### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
We began by taking a deeper look in the starting pitch assignment. This led us to divide up the tasks to build up a sufficient pitch. Half of the team will be alotted to pitch documentation, while the other half will take charge of building wireframes and system digrams to better portray our idea of the Bullet Journal.

We decided to allot time this Saturday to work on the Pitch. We want every person to come up with persona and we can consolodate them into 4 complete personas with a great amount of background. Wireframing will be handled by Alan and the system diagrams will be formed as a collaboartive effort on Saturday.

Key factors: low fidelity wireframing, high fidelity wireframing get them done this week
Attend professor office hours along with cross team discussion.
