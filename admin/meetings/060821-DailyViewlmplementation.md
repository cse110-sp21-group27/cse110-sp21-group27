### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
The focus of this meeting was to full assign roles for the user end documentation to Xun, onboarding documentation to Richie and Sarah, and finally Alan's plan for the Video. Given these things, we were able to make strides in fully implementing the daily view in terms of storage. We built a schema for the daily view storage and were able to add a way to specify the given day that you are planning to schedule for. This was a huge step forward as our forgone idea of the weekly view was somewhat brought back with feature implementation. However, there were some issues dealing with the jQuery drag and drop and as a result we had to finish on a cliffhanger and complete more research as to why we kept finding a crashing situation.
