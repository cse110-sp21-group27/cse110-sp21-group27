# Implementing Weekly view

* Status: [removed]
* Deciders:[Team Decision]
* Date: [2021-05-31] 


## Context and Problem Statement

After meeting with the team we realized that we were falling a little behind on the development of the daily view and decided to focus just on daily view. We also decided that if everything goes to plan we might atempt to implement weekly view but at the moment it is not likely. If we did not implement weekly view it gives us more time to develop more test as well as solidifying other functions. All in all, the team would continue to debug and better implement other functions as well as other activities like team video and documentations.

## Considered Options

* Just work daily view
* Continue to test more
* improve effort on other elements
## Decision Outcome
We choose to not implement weekly view as we had limited time till deadline.

### Positive Consequences
* This will lead to more productivity on other functions and elements in the project

### Negative Consequences
* May affect user experience as many would find the weekly view usefull in term of planning future task.
