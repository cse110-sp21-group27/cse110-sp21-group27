### *The agenda of what is discussed:*
Deepak went over GitHub actions and explained the process that is expected from us. For this pipeline phase, we should have 3 workflows (docs, linting, and testing). Furthermore,
Deepak also suggests to have the diagram, walk through, and video done by Monday in order to focus on getting started with the project. The next step is to just complete the .yml files
so we can upload them to the repo.
